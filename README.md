## Warning:
There could be some libraries missing. I will fix this as I am still learning with kicad and this is my first published project. Just let me know. **As of today (January 2019) this is still work in progress. Not tested. Build at your own risk!**

## To do:
- firmware
- 3D printed case

## License:
This is open hardware, use, make, modify. Just let me know any improvement. I will welcome any fix or upgrade. Thank you.
